This is my **Master's thesis** project. The main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate my approach, named **HARD-DevOps**: a decentralized model based on **Cassandra DHT**, focusing on two essential mechanisms: **replication** and **restoration**. This approach ensures the **high availability** and **resilience** of CI/CD pipelines.

## My Approach: **HARD-DevOps**
Detailed documentation about the implemented CI/CD pipeline and the system architecture can be found in the `/docs` folder.

## Injecting Failures
To evaluate the resilience of the system, I used the **Chaosd** tool. For more information, see [chaosd.md](chaosd.md).

## Challenges and Solutions
For a detailed overview of the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented, see [challenges-and-solutions.md](challenges-and-solutions.md).
